# Instructions To Run
1. Remember to run the command `npm install` before trying to run the project
2. In one terminal, run the command `node ./src/server.js` from the root of the project to ensure the backend server is running.
3. With the first terminal still open, open a second terminal and run the command `npm run serve` from the root of the project to ensure the frontend is running.
4. In a web browser, navigate to `localhost:8080` to see the project in action.
